Then we will select a template for the dashboard :

Select the one you want and click "*ok*" twice.
> *In this example we will use the "3 Columns Template"*

On the left rectangle we have our layout elements composed of rows and columns.

Pentaho uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) logic by default which means that you can create a responsive and designed layout quickly.
> Bootstrap uses a grid system :
Like any grid system, the Bootstrap grid is a library of HTML/CSS components that allow you to structure content in desired locations easily.
It allows you to create rows and columns and then place content in the "intersected" areas.
Now the question is, how many rows and columns you can create using Bootstrap's Grid System ? Bootstrap allows you to create  **unlimited rows** and up to **12 columns** per row.

> In the example above :
> * a row with 1 column
>   *  an html object
> * a row with nothing, just to make a little space
> * a row with 3 columns
> * a row with nothing, just to make a little space
> * a row with 1 column
>   *  an html object
