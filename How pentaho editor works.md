# How pentaho editor works

We will focus on these 3 tabs (left to right) : layout, components and datasources panels.
* layout panel : here you choose the general structure of the page like where is the title and where you can put things
* components panel : here you create component that you'll fit in one layout element and also choose what datasource this component receives
* datasource panel : here you can create sql queries with parameters (or not) with the data you want to work with

Then the workflow to use pentaho is to :
1. set the datasource youâ€™ll need
2. create the layout you want with space for all the element like maps, tables and other
3. create the components
