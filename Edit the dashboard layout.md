Here are some examples on how to customize the dashboard layout.
They were made with the "*3 Columns Template*" template.

## Change the size of a layout element

Let’s change the size of the header element.
* click on a row then one of its child 
* change the value “*Extra Small Devices*”, “*Small Devices*”, “*Medium Devices*” and “*Large Devices*”
> Note that if you want the same size for all, just edit one device size
